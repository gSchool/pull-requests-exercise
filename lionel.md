something cool.
Something written
something else written, new
something lost, something
else we can't 
something something
I forget the somethings else, I forget myself - 
something.

I forget to ask you something I forget to tell you some. 
I forgot to tell you that, and now it's something
of a problem
and now its something you aren't.
